The plugin uses Stripe Connect OAuth for secure authentication. This means you authorize the plugin to process payments on your behalf without sharing your API keys.

## Initial Connection

1. Navigate to **WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > Stripe Deposits**
2. Click the **Connect with Stripe** button
3. You'll be redirected to Stripe's authorization page
4. Log in to your Stripe account (or create one if needed)
5. Review the permissions and click **Authorize**
6. You'll be redirected back to your WordPress admin

Once connected, you'll see your Stripe account status displayed in the settings.

<Callout>
Your Stripe connection is securely encrypted using AES-256-CBC encryption. Your credentials are never stored in plain text.
</Callout>

## Test Mode vs Live Mode

The plugin supports both test and live modes:

| Mode | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **Test Mode** | Development and testing. No real charges are made. |
| **Live Mode** | Production. Real payments are processed. |

### Switching Modes

1. Go to **WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > Stripe Deposits**
2. Find the **Test Mode** toggle
3. Enable for testing, disable for live transactions

<Callout>
Always test your payment plans thoroughly in test mode before going live. Use Stripe's test card numbers to simulate different scenarios.
</Callout>

## Disconnecting Stripe

To disconnect your Stripe account:

1. Go to **WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > Stripe Deposits**
2. Click the **Disconnect** button
3. Confirm the disconnection

You can reconnect at any time by clicking **Connect with Stripe** again.

<Callout>
Disconnecting will not affect existing payment plans. Customers with active plans will continue to be charged on schedule.
</Callout>

## Webhook Configuration

Webhooks allow Stripe to notify your site when payments succeed or fail. The plugin automatically registers webhooks when you connect your Stripe account.

If you need to manually verify webhooks:

1. Log in to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Navigate to **Developers > Webhooks**
3. Verify the endpoint URL matches your site

The plugin listens for these events:
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- `invoice.payment_failed`
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `payment_intent.payment_failed`
