When a customer qualifies for payment plans, they'll see options at checkout to either pay in full or select a payment plan.

## Payment Plan Selection

Customers see a payment plan selector with:

1. **Pay in Full** - Standard single payment for the order total
2. **Available Payment Plans** - One or more plan options with details

Here's an interactive example of what customers see at checkout:

<PaymentPlanCard />

### What Customers See

When a customer selects a payment plan, the display shows:

- **Deposit Due Today** - Amount charged immediately
- **Number of Installments** - Total payments in the plan
- **Payment Schedule** - Dates and amounts for each payment
- **Auto-Deduction Notice** - Reminder that future payments are automatic

### Example Display

For a $500 order with a 20% deposit and 4 monthly payments:

```
Due Today: $100.00 (Deposit)

Payment Schedule:
- March 15, 2025: $100.00
- April 15, 2025: $100.00
- May 15, 2025: $100.00
- June 15, 2025: $100.00

Your card will be automatically charged on each date.
```

Customers can complete their purchase using:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
