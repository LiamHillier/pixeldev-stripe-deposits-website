Deposits and Payment Plans for Stripe WooCommerce enables you to accept deposits and split payments into installments, giving your customers flexible ways to pay while ensuring you get paid on time.

## What You Can Do

- **Accept Deposits** - Collect a percentage or fixed amount upfront at checkout
- **Create Payment Plans** - Split the remaining balance into automatic installments
- **Target Specific Customers** - Use 20+ conditions to control who sees which plans
- **Automate Payments** - Stripe automatically charges customers on schedule
- **Send Reminders** - Notify customers before each payment is due

## How It Works

1. **Customer checks out** and selects a payment plan
2. **Deposit is charged** immediately to their card, ACH, or Stripe Link
3. **Remaining payments** are automatically charged on the scheduled dates
4. **Reminders are sent** before each payment (optional)

## Payment Methods

The plugin supports three payment methods through Stripe:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Credit/Debit Cards** | Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and more |
| **ACH Bank Transfer** | Direct bank payments for US customers |
| **Stripe Link** | One-click checkout with saved payment info |
