## Plan Selection Mode

Determines how payment plans appear when multiple plans match a customer's cart.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Priority Mode** | Only the highest-priority plan is shown. Simple choice between "Pay in Full" or the selected plan. |
| **Customer Choice** | All matching plans are displayed. Customers choose between available options. |

### When to Use Each Mode

**Priority Mode** is best when:
- You have one main payment plan
- You want a simple checkout experience
- Different plans target different customer segments (they won't overlap)

**Customer Choice** is best when:
- You offer multiple payment options (e.g., 3-month and 6-month plans)
- You want customers to choose their preferred schedule
- Plans may overlap for the same cart

## Gateway Settings

Configure how the payment method appears at checkout.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Gateway Title** | Name shown at checkout (e.g., "Credit Card / Debit Card") |
| **Gateway Description** | Additional text displayed during checkout |
| **Test Mode** | Toggle between test and live Stripe keys |
| **Maximum Payment Retries** | Number of retry attempts for failed payments (1-10) |

### Payment Retries

When a scheduled payment fails (e.g., expired card, insufficient funds), the system will automatically retry:

- **Default:** 3 retries
- **Maximum:** 10 retries
- **Retry timing:** Configured in your Stripe subscription settings

After all retries are exhausted, the payment plan is marked as failed and the customer is notified.

## Email Settings

Configure payment reminder notifications.

### Enabling Reminders

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable Payment Reminders** | Toggle reminder emails on/off |

### Email Template Customization

Customize every part of the reminder email:

| Section | Description |

| **Subject Line** | Email subject with placeholders |
| **Email Heading** | Main title of the email |
| **Body Introduction** | Opening greeting |
| **Main Message** | Core content of the email |
| **Footer Text** | Closing message |
| **Button Text** | Call-to-action button label |

### Available Placeholders

Insert these anywhere in your templates:

| Placeholder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `{customer_name}` | Customer's first name |
| `{order_number}` | WooCommerce order number |
| `{order_url}` | Link to view order |

| `{amount}` | Payment amount (formatted with currency) |
| `{due_date}` | Payment due date |
