Payment plans let you split orders into a deposit and multiple installments. Navigate to **WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > Stripe Deposits** and select the **Plans** tab to get started.

## Creating a Payment Plan

Click **Add Plan** to create a new payment plan. Each plan has several configuration sections.

### Basic Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Plan Name** | Display name shown to customers (required) |
| **Description** | Optional details about the plan |
| **Enabled** | Toggle to activate/deactivate the plan |
| **Priority** | Order when multiple plans match (lower = higher priority) |

### Deposit Configuration

Configure whether to require an upfront deposit:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable Deposit** | Toggle to require a deposit payment |
| **Deposit Type** | Choose "Percentage" or "Fixed Amount" |
| **Deposit Value** | Amount as percentage (0-100%) or fixed currency amount |

### Fixed Payments

Set a specific number of installments with regular intervals.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Number of Payments** | Total installments (e.g., 3, 4, 6) |
| **First Payment Offset** | Delay before first installment after deposit |
| **Payment Interval** | Frequency between payments (days/weeks/months) |

**Example:** 4 monthly payments with 20% deposit on a $500 order:

- Today: $100 deposit
- Month 1: $100
- Month 2: $100
- Month 3: $100
- Month 4: $100

### ACF Date Field

Dynamic scheduling based on a product's date field. Useful for events, courses, or seasonal products.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **ACF Field Name** | Name of the date field (e.g., "event_date") |
| **Date Offset** | When to complete payments relative to the date |
| **First Payment Offset** | Delay before first installment after deposit |
| **Payment Interval** | Frequency between payments |

**Example:** Event on December 31, with -1 month offset and monthly intervals. Payments are calculated to finish by November 30, and the system works backward to fit monthly payments between now and the deadline.

<Callout>
This schedule type requires the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin with a date field on your products.

### Due By Date

All payments must complete by a specific deadline.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Due Date** | Fixed deadline for final payment (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| **First Payment Offset** | Delay before first installment after deposit |
| **Payment Interval** | Frequency between payments |

**Example:** Due by June 30, 2025 with monthly intervals. The system calculates how many monthly payments fit between now and the deadline and spreads the balance across available payment slots.

## Payment Intervals

Configure the timing between installments:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Interval Value** | Number (e.g., 1, 2, 4) |
| **Interval Unit** | Days, Weeks, or Months |

**Common configurations:**

- Monthly payments: Value = 1, Unit = Months
- Bi-weekly payments: Value = 2, Unit = Weeks
- Weekly payments: Value = 1, Unit = Weeks

## First Payment Offset

The first payment offset determines when the first installment is due after the deposit. This only applies when deposits are enabled.

**Example:** With a 1-month first payment offset:

- Deposit: Charged today
- First installment: 1 month from today
- Subsequent installments: Based on payment interval

## Managing Plans

### Enable/Disable Plans

Toggle plans on or off without deleting them. Disabled plans won't appear at checkout.

### Plan Priority

When multiple plans match a customer's cart, priority determines which appears first:

- Lower numbers = higher priority
- In **Priority Mode**, only the highest-priority plan is shown
- In **Customer Choice Mode**, all matching plans are shown, sorted by priority

### Deleting Plans

Click the delete button to remove a plan. This won't affect existing active payment plans for customers.
